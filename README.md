# ArcMenu
This is my first git deposition and it is an android menu test projrct.
I got this from imooc.
The menu and sub menu are displaced like Satellites. 
Each SubMenu has rotate and remove animation.
The main menu can be displaced in the 4conrners of your screen and you can set the distance of the main menu and the sub menu.
